# Retina Macbook Pro 15 2015 Hardware Hacks ðŸ’¡

## Charger hack

Macbook Pro 15 2015 originally charges with 85W Magsafe 2 Apple charger. It gets bad after a year or two and forces you to buy a new one.
In order to hack the charger you need:
- Apple 87W or 96W Type-C charger (could be used one)
- [Ugreen 85W nylon braided Magsafe 2 <=> Type-C cable](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003798009526.html).

[Here](https://github.com/banonymous/Macbook-Pro-2015-Custom-85W-Charger-Magsafe-2-Type-C) are additional metrics of different chargers testings.

## Hidden microSD adapter

BaseQI produces MicroSD card adapter which suits macbook color and hides completely inside of chassis withoud sticking out. 
You can add up to 512GB with USB 2.0 read/write speed.
You need [BaseQI 504A](https://aliexpress.com/item/32820381120.html).

## Dust plugs into ports 

Just for aesthetics BaseQI produces [iHut aluminum dust plugs](https://aliexpress.com/item/32862599440.html) for all ports - HDMI, 2xUSB, 2xMiniDisplayPort.


## Faster SSD hack

Macbook Pro 15 2015 has a replaceble SSD with proprietary connector which does not match with NVMe SSD blades.

In order to use NVMe SSD blade like WD SN550 on your Macbook with support of hibernation and swapping you should use [Sintech adapter](http://eshop.sintech.cn/ngff-m2-pcie-ssd-card-as-2013-2014-2015-macbook-ssd-p-1139.html). 

You need Pentaloub and Torx screwdrivers to replace SSD.

Here is the [detailed manual on Macrumors forum](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upgrading-2013-2014-macbook-pro-ssd-to-m-2-nvme.2034976/). Also there is info about replacing SSD in Macbook Pro 2013 and 2014.  

Macbook Pro 15 2015 supports SSDs with PCIe 3.0 speed.
Here is the [proof](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upgrading-2013-2014-macbook-pro-ssd-to-m-2-nvme.2034976/page-459)

It means that aftermarket SSD like WD SN550 2TB will perform 3GB/s read and write speeds which enhances swapping. 

NB: Macbook Pro 15 2014 and earlier supports SSDs with PCIe 2.0 speed only (1.5GB/s of read and write speeds). 

## Portable stand

There are plenty of stands for Macbook.
Here is the [small raiser stand](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000865097835.html) which raises Macbook to 5 degrees inclination angle from the table.

## Key caps replacement 

New [set of key caps](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005004129980559.html) is being sold with plastic pry tool.

With plastic prying tool its easy to replace keycaps just by pry them up from the bottom right by pressing on the scissor mechanism and pulling the key cap up.

## Thermal Mod (only for savages) 

2 thermal pads (each of 60x20x1mm) could be added to the heatsink just above coolers inside of the rubber stripes. Take a look at [the photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/ja61nu/macbook_pro_15_2015_thermal_pads_on_heatsink_play/) - just like that.

Take [Thermal Grizzly 120x20x1mm](https://aliexpress.com/item/4001227065123.html) thermal pad and split it up into 2 pieces for each cooler.
