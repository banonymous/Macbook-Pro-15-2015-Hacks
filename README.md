Retina Macbook Pro 15 2015 Hacks

#MicroSD slot
BaseQI produces MicroSD card adapter which suits macbook color and hides completely inside of chassis withoud sticking out. 

#Aluminum dust plugs
Just for aesthetics BaseQI produces iHut aluminum dust plugs for all the port.

#SSD
With Sintech adapter you can use cheap and fast NVMe blades. 
Macbook Pro 15 2015 supports SSDs with PCIe 3.0 speed. It means that aftermarket SSD like WD SN550 2TB will perform 3GB/s read and write speeds which enhances swapping. 
NB: Macbook Pro 15 2014 and earlier supports SSDs with PCIe 2.0 speed only (1.5GB/s of read and write speeds). 

#Thermal Mod
2 thermal pads (each of 60x20x1mm) could be added to the heatsink just above coolers inside of the rubber stripes.
I used Thermal Grizzly 120x20x1mm and splitted it into 2 pieces.

#Key caps replacement 
With plastic prying tool its easy to replace keycaps just by pry them up from the bottom right by pressing on the scissor mechanism and pulling the key cap up.
